### Foreword 
I'm *hopelessly* addicted to my iPhone. It got to a point where I was wasting 6+ hours of my day scrolling through videos that I didn't really care about to avoid having to do things that actually mattered. To try and get away from this problem, I bought a Light Phone, which markets itself as a phone that still works as a tool (it calls, texts, takes pictures, even navigates to places you if you ask real nice) without being able to access software that's designed to suck away your attention and free time. As a result, the Light Phone III doesn't have an app store or web browser. 

Now, this is a feature, not a bug, and has been working for me just fine for the most part. However, I *really* like knowing what the weather is, especially these days (it's 80 out in mid November.) So, I figured that I would take advantage of one of the few things that my new phone *can* do (text) and build a tool that can retrieve weather data via openweather's API and feed it to an SMS gateway (Fonoster, the first result when you look up Twilio (the most popular SMS gateway for businesses) is the gateway I'm using, if you were curious) that will send it to my number when I ask it to. 

Unfortunately, this is a *little* harder than I expected it to be. While I have every intention to finish this project before the end of the week, I'm a little out of my depth for an introductory project assigned two weeks ago that's due in an hour. So instead, I'm going to be installing the example voting app that is listed in the assignment and just showing Codi the thing I made later. 

### Step one: Installing Docker on a fresh VM
I'm using a Debian VM for this, so i'll be using the apt package manager. Fortunately for us (me), docker gives thorough, step by step instructions for this. Here they are:
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF
Types: deb
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
Components: stable
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
EOF

sudo apt update
```
I followed these instructions verbatim. This section is just instructions on how to add docker's public key and apt repository to your machine.

Now that you have docker's repo on your machine, you can install all of the packages you need to use docker and docker compose. Install them with this command: 
`sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin`

Congrats! You have successfully installed Docker and Docker Compose.

### Step 2: Installing the sample voting app
Installation is pretty straightforward. Clone the app to your machine and move into its created directory: 
`git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app`
`cd example-voting-app`

Then, you can just use docker compose.
`docker compose up`

Your terminal should do something that looks like this:

Then, go to FireFox and go to http://localhost:8080. If it lookst like this, you did it!

Congrats!
